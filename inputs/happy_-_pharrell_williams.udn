[verse 1]
(F7)It might seem crazy what I'm about to say (Fm7) (Bb) (C) (Bb)
Sunshine she's here, you can take a break
I'm a hot air balloon that could go to space
With the air, like I don't care baby by the way

|[chorus]
|Because I'm (C#)happy
|Clap along (Cm7)if you feel like a (Eb)room without a (F)roof
|Because I'm happy
|Clap along if you feel like happiness is the truth
|Because I'm happy
|Clap along if you know what happiness is to you
|Because I'm happy
|Clap along if you feel like that's what you wanna do

[verse 2]
Here come bad news talking this and that, yeah,
Well, give me all you got, and don't hold it back, yeah,
Well, I should probably warn you I'll be just fine, yeah,
No offense to you, don't waste your time
Here's why

[chorus]
[bridge]
{clapping}

(Happy) Bring me down...can't nothing
Bring me down... my level's too high
Bring me down... can't nothing
Bring me down... I said (let me tell you now)
Bring me down... can't nothing
Bring me down... my level's too high
Bring me down... can't nothing
Bring me down... I said

[Chorus x2]
